# Student Evaluations Tool

My Final Codaisseur project:

- A tool for teachers to rate students based upon their daily performance.
- The teacher can select a random student to ask a question, check'The Important Part'
- Frameworks used are React.js, React-Redux with a RESTful Express API on top of MongoDB combined with Mongoose.

## The Important Part ;)
```
As a Teacher, from the class view I can click a button “ASK A QUESTION”.
It shows me the name and picture of a random student to ask a question.
Not entirely random though: RED students get ~49% of the questions
YELLOW students ~33%, and GREEN students ~18%.
```

- Written test for the algorithm: see Exp-eva/lib/tekstRandomizerTest.js
- Run it a 1.000.000 to check the proper percentages.
